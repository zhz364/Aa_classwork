# Partner B: White Boarding

# Ask your partner the below questions! **Don't spend longer than 20 minutes per
# coding question.** Start a timer once the question has finished being read (or
# the relevant information has been presented).

# ## Question One

# What are the disadvantages of adding an index to a table column in a database?


# #Zhang's answer

  # The disadvantages of adding an index to a table column will slow down your method, because 
  # it will costs more memory (RAM, SSD). Adding an index creates more times of updating the index
  # from every CRUD(create, read, update, delete) databse operation.


#############################################################################
# **Answer**: Indices do have a cost. They make writes (`INSERT`s, `DELETE`s, and
# `UPDATE`s) a little more taxing because the index table must also be updated.












## Question Two

# Given the following table write all the `belongs_to` and `has_many` associations
# for models based on the below table (`User`, `Enrollment`, and `Course`)

```ruby

# == Schema Information
#
# Table name: users
#
#  id   :integer                not null, primary key
#  name :string                 not null


# Table name: enrollments
#
#  id   :integer                not null, primary key
#  course_id :integer           not null
#  student_id :integer          not null


# Table name: courses
#
#  id   :integer                not null, primary key
#  course_name :string          not null
#  professor_id :integer        not null
#  prereq_course_id :integer    not null
```

#Solution: 

#User.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :enrollments,
    primary_key: :id,
    foreign_key: :student_id,
    class_name: :Enrollment

  has_many :courses_taught,
    primary_key: :id,
    foreign_key: :professor_id,
    class_name: 'Course'
    optional: true
end
#Enrollments.rb
class Enrollment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :course,
    primary_key: :id,
    foreign_key: :course_id,
    class_name: 'Course'


  belongs_to :student,
      primary_key: :id,
      foreign_key: :student_id,
      class_name: :User    
end

#Course.rb
class Course < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :enrollments,
    primary_key: :id,
    foreign_key: :course_id,
    class_name: :Enrollment

  belongs_to :professor,
    primary_key: :id,
    foreign_key: :professor_id,
    class_name: :User

  belongs_to :prerequisite,
    primary_key: :id,
    foreign_key: :prereq_course_id,
    class_name: :Course
    optional: true

  has_many :courses,
    primary_key: :id,
    foreign_key: :prereq_course_id,
    class_name: :Courses
end












### Solutions

Below are all the `belongs_to` and `has_many` associations:

```ruby
class Enrollment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user,
    class_name: 'User',
    foreign_key: :student_id,
    primary_key: :id

  belongs_to :course,
    class_name: 'Course',
    foreign_key: :course_id,
    primary_key: :id
end

class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :enrollments,
    class_name: 'Enrollment',
    foreign_key: :student_id,
    primary_key: :id

  has_many :courses_taught,
    class_name: 'Course',
    foreign_key: :professor_id,
    primary_key: :id,
    optional: true
end

class Course < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :enrollments,
    class_name: 'Enrollment',
    foreign_key: :course_id,
    primary_key: :id

  belongs_to :prerequisite,
    class_name: 'Course',
    foreign_key: :prereq_course_id,
    primary_key: :id,
    optional: true

  belongs_to :professor,
    class_name: 'User',
    foreign_key: :professor_id,
    primary_key: :id
end
```

## Question Three

Given all possible SQL commands order by order of query execution. (SELECT,
DISTINCT, FROM, JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, LIMIT/OFFSET, ORDER).

######Zhang's answer:
FROM, 
JOIN,
WHERE, 
GROUP BY, 
HAVING, 
SELECT,
DISTINCT, 
ORDER
LIMIT/OFFSET, 

##########################################


#Fresh JalapeÃ±os with garlic have smelly dirty odors lovingly,

**Answer**:

1. FROM and JOINs
2. WHERE
3. GROUP BY
4. HAVING
5. SELECT
6. DISTINCT
7. ORDER BY
8. LIMIT / OFFSET

## Question Four

Given the following table:

```ruby
# == Schema Information
#
# Table name: nobels
#
#  yr          :integer
#  subject     :string
#  winner      :string

```

Write the following SQL Query:

1.  In which years was the Physics prize awarded, but no Chemistry prize?
#Dave's answer
SELECT
  nobels.yr
From
  nobels
WHICH
  #physics prize was awarded AND no chemistry prize
  (subject = 'Physics' AND yr NOT IN (
    SELECT  
      yr  
    FROM
      nobels
    WHERE
    subject = 'Chemistry'
  ));




#### Solution

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    yr
FROM
    nobels
WHERE
    (subject = 'Physics' AND yr NOT IN (
    SELECT
        yr
    FROM
        nobels
    WHERE
        subject = 'Chemistry'
    ));


```

## Question Five

What is the purpose of a database migration?

#Zhang's answer:
We can create table. Changing the columns name. drop the table. create the table.

bundle exec rails g migration DropComments

drop_table :comment

bundle exec rails g migration CreateComments2


bundle exec rails generate migration Create_Dogs
bundle exec rails generate migration AdzDogs
bundle exec rails generate migration rename<Name of Table>

#RENAME TABLE
#$ rails g migration change_[old_table_name]_to_[new_table_name]




#20200831900880.create_comments2.rb

# class CreateComments2 < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
#   def change
#     create_table :comments do |t|  MAKE SURE TO DELETE THE 2!
#       t.string :body, null: false
#       t.integer :video_id, null: false
#       t.integer :commenter_id, null: false
#       t.integer :parent_comment_id

#       t.timestamps
#     end
#     add_index :comments, :video_id
#     add_index :comments, :commenter_id
#     add_index :comments, :parent_comment_id
#   end
# end








#####################################################################################

**Answer**: A migration is a file containing Ruby code that describes a set of
changes to be applied to a database. It may create or drop tables as well as add
or remove columns from a table.

## Question Six

What is the difference between Database Constraints and Active Record
Validations?

**Answer**: **Validations** are defined inside **models**. Model-level
validations live in the Rails world. Since we write them in Ruby, they are very
flexible, database agnostic, and convenient to test, maintain and reuse.
Validations are run whenever we `save` or `update` a model. **Constraints** are
defined inside **migrations** and operate on the database. Constraints throw
hard nasty errors whenever something that shouldn't be inputted into our
database tries to get in there.

## Question Seven

Given the following table write all the `belongs_to` and `has_many` associations
for models based on the below table (`User`, `Game`, and `Score`)

```ruby
# == Schema Information
#
# Table name: user
#
#  id   :integer          not null, primary key
#  name :string           not null


# Table name: score
#
#  id   :integer           not null, primary key
#  number :integer         not null
#  user_id :integer        not null
#  game_id :integer        not null


# Table name: game
#
#  id   :integer           not null, primary key
#  name :string            not null
#  game_maker_id :integer  not null
```

#### Solution

```ruby
class Score < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user,
    class_name: 'User',
    foreign_key: :user_id,
    primary_key: :id

  belongs_to :game,
    class_name: 'Game',
    foreign_key: :game_id,
    primary_key: :id
end

class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :games_made,
    class_name: 'Game',
    foreign_key: :game_maker_id,
    primary_key: :id,
    optional: true

  has_many :scores,
    class_name: 'Score',
    foreign_key: :user_id,
    primary_key: :id

end

class Game < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :game_maker,
    class_name: 'User',
    foreign_key: :game_maker_id,
    primary_key: :id

  has_many :scores,
    class_name: 'Score',
    foreign_key: :game_id,
    primary_key: :id
end

```
